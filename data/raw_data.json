He was a Fellow at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla (2008-2010), and Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust (May-June 2017); and a Visiting Professor at the School of Arts and Sciences, Ahmedabad University (2018). Interested in the history of ideas with a particular focus on nineteenth and twentieth-century India, Mukherji specialises in Intellectual history, with a particular focus on capacious concepts, the imagining of modern India, Vivekananda, Tagore, Gandhi, Post Colonialism, and the Mahabharata. His books, published internationally, have been credited with generous reviews by some of the leading experts in the field. He served as the Convener of the International Seminar on Exploring NonViolence organised at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla, from October 20-22, 2008; the International Seminar on The Home and the World: Rabindranath Tagore sponsored by Ministry of Culture, Government of India, and organised at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla, during November 14-16, 2011, the Joint Coordinator of the Summer School on Exploring Agency in the Mahabharata: Ethical, Political and Dharmic organised at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla, during September 17-30, 2012, and the Coordinator of the Winter School on Life and Thought of Gandhi organised at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla, from December 1-15, 2016.",
